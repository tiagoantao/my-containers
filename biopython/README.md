Biopython containers
====================

You can find two containers here:


1. Biopython: It will create a full installation that can be used
   interactively.

2. Biopython-Test: It will create a buildbot image. Note that you have
   to download the file, EDIT THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD and only then
   you can build.

You are probably interested on the first (unless you want to help test
Biopython or want to see the inner guts of a builbbot image)

There are a few templates that are merged to generate the images above:

1. Biopython-Basic: The necessary software for Biopython.

2. Bioypython-Run: Prepares the container for interactive run.

3. Bioypython-Buildbot: Prepares the container for buildbot.
